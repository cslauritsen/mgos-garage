# Reset to factory defaults is done by configuring a reset button, attached to a certain GPIO pin. Two modes are possible:
#  * Hold the reset button and reboot the device while holding a button. 
#    For this, set provision.btn.pin to a non-negative value, and 
#    set provision.btn.hold_ms to 0.
#  * Just hold the reset button pressed for a long time. 
#    For this, set provision.btn.pin to a non-negative value, and 
#    set provision.btn.hold_ms to a positive value, e.g. 5000 - 5 seconds. 
#    If you also set provision.btn.inhibit_after_s value to non-zero number of seconds, 
#    reset button will be inhibited once uptime reaches this value (reset button will stop working N seconds after boot).
  - ["provision.btn.pin", 5 ]
  - ["provision.btn.hold_ms", 5000 ]
  - ["provision.btn.pull_up", true ]

# this is a nice feature but unfortunately the onboard led is
# connected to my relay GPIO
  - ["provision.led.pin", -1 ]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
